# KAN-5 Error Analysis

## Summary

This is a **test/synthetic error** generated by Sentry's testing functionality, not a legitimate bug in the codebase.

## Evidence

### 1. Error Message Pattern
The error message `[Test Error bzi3no] Something went wrong at 2026-01-19T14:13:12.248Z` contains:
- **"Test Error" prefix** - Standard Sentry test error indicator
- **Random identifier** (`bzi3no`) - Unique test identifier
- **Timestamp format** - Programmatically generated timestamp

### 2. Code Analysis at Error Location
- **File:** `/components/Header.tsx`
- **Reported Line:** 26:17
- **Actual Content:** Line 26 is an **empty line** between two `useEffect` hooks

```tsx
// Line 24:     setIsDark(true);
// Line 25:   }
// Line 26: (empty line)  <-- Reported error location
// Line 27: useEffect(() => {
```

An empty line cannot throw an error - this confirms the stack trace was synthetically generated.

### 3. Code Review Findings
The Header.tsx component (105 lines) is well-structured with:
- Proper TypeScript interfaces
- Clean React hooks usage (`useState`, `useEffect`)
- No unsafe operations or error-prone code patterns
- Proper error handling in dependent hooks (`useCLIStatus`, `useWebSocket`)

### 4. Sentry Integration Context
The codebase has Sentry webhook integration configured in `/app/services/dashboard-v2/src/features/webhooks/fixtures.ts`:
```typescript
{
  name: "Sentry Alerts",
  provider: "sentry",
  url: "https://hooks.machine.io/sentry"
}
```

This confirms Sentry is integrated and test errors from Sentry would flow through this system.

## Decision

**No PR Created** - This is a synthetic test error, not a real bug.

## Recommendations

1. **Close or ignore this ticket** - No code changes are required
2. **Add test error filtering** - Consider filtering out Sentry test errors from automatic ticket creation
3. **Document test error pattern** - Pattern `[Test Error *]` should be recognized as non-actionable

## Files Analyzed

| File | Purpose | Issues Found |
|------|---------|--------------|
| `/app/services/dashboard-v2/src/components/ui/Header.tsx` | Main component | None |
| `/app/services/dashboard-v2/src/components/ui/Header.test.tsx` | Test file | None |
| `/app/services/dashboard-v2/src/hooks/useCLIStatus.ts` | CLI status hook | None |
| `/app/services/dashboard-v2/src/hooks/useWebSocket.ts` | WebSocket hook | None |

## Conclusion

The error `[Test Error bzi3no] Something went wrong at 2026-01-19T14:13:12.248Z` is a **Sentry test error** used to verify the Sentry-to-Jira integration pipeline. The reported location (line 26:17 in Header.tsx) points to an empty line, confirming this is not a real runtime error.

**No code changes required.**
